# ABOUT-ME
## NAME: Kenneth Jackson
---
Some of my favorite things to do is to make music, skate, make all kinds of art, and hang with friends/make new friends. When I say skate, I don't mean ~~roller~~ skate, I mean with a **board**... and the ground. I love making music, which I do pretty much everyday, and I do it either by myself or with others. Those are pretty much my top 3 *favorite* things to do.
